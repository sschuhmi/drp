## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

This project includes a data set containing real messages that were sent during disaster events. 

Based on these, a machine learning pipeline was created to categorize these events so that one can send the messages to an appropriate disaster relief agency.

The project also includes a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app also displays visualizations of the data.
